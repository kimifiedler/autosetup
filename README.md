# AutoSetup

AutoSetup is a C# WinForms application designed to help users create and manage setups. A setup contains a collection of different files, programs, and processes that the user selects. These setups are stored locally, making it easy to save, retrieve, and manage multiple configurations.

## Features

- **Create Setups**: Easily create setups that contain a collection of files, programs, and processes.
- **Custom Actions**: Set processes to open, minimize, or close as part of the setup configuration.
- **Simple Interface**: A straightforward WinForms-based graphical user interface (GUI).

## How It Works

1. **Creating a Setup**:
    - Select files, programs, or processes to be part of the setup.
    - Define the action for each process (e.g., open, minimize, or close).
    - Save the setup, which is then stored locally.

2. **Managing Setups**:
    - Retrieve and manage previously saved setups.
    - Execute the setup, which applies the defined actions to the selected processes.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **WinForms**
- **SQLite** for database storage

## Usage

- If you want to look in to the code, feel free to do so. If you just want to use the programm navigate to the debug folder where the .exe is created. :)
